<h2>Assignment 2: Implementing a dynamic web site</h2>
<p><STRONG>Due: 9:00am <span class="strike">Friday 21<sup>st</sup></span> Monday 24<sup>th</sup> September 2018
  Â <BR>
</STRONG></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You are to apply all the Web technologies (DOM, XML, Ajax, PHP, Oracle, etc.) 
learnt from lectures and practicals to make the site that you created in 
<a href="assignment1.html">Assignment One</a> <em>fully functional</em>. That is, </p>
<ul>
<li>To validate the <em><strong>checkout form</strong></em> using Ajax and PHP <b>on server side</b>. 
User's input is validated on the fly. If error is found, appropriate information is displayed.   </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
 <ul type="circle">
    <li>All required fields should be checked for completion, and all data  
	that are entered should be checked for 'correctness'. For example,  
	buyer contact details (name, phone number, email  address, etc.), 
	delivery address (unit number/street name, city, postal code,  etc.), delivery method selected 
	and payment methods (credit card number, expiry date, card holder name,  CVV, etc.) 
	are fields expected in the checkout form to be validated.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Regular expression is recommended (NOT compulsory) for pattern matching in PHP. <br /><br />
    </li>
	<li>You decide what validation is required and how the validation is  performed. For instance,
    </li>
 </ul>
 
 <ul type="disc">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>the <em>required</em> fields checked for completion </li>
    <li>the fields checked for a specific length, numeric data or a predetermined format 
	</li>
    <li>the messages provided help the user fix the 'problem'</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

 
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To develop the system to respond to the forms by accessing your products/services XML files, 
querying your <b>Oracle</b> database, generating contents, and adding information to the database. 
Your PHP code needs  to be used to enable</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>search sugguestions: a suggest/autocomplete box similar to Google Suggest,  
	where a user gets suggested products/sevices while typing in the search form. <br>
      <br>
    Example: User is typing a brand/product name:
    <p class="red-indented">  Emma    </p>
      <p>Suggestions which would be displayed:</p>
      <p class="red-indented"> Emma Tub Armchair<br>
      </p>
	  
	  <!--If user selects one suggestion, the corresponding detail page is loaded. -->
    </li>
	
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>search function: the <em><strong>search form</strong></em> responds to user's input 
	with retrieved information from server side (using xml or database). When user clicks on "search" button, 
	a search result page is loaded. If a product link is clicked from suggestion list or result page, user is led to the product detail page, where user can add the product to a shopping cart. <br> <br>
    </li>
    <li>shopping cart: it allows a user to   place items in the  cart and  calculates 
	a total for the order, including shipping and   handling (i.e. postage and packing) 
	charges and the associated taxes (e.g. GST), as   applicable upon checkout. 
	After checkout, all the data from the completed form will be inserted into the relevant table. 
	A  receipt page confirming the order that has been made should be displayed or in  the event of an error, 
	an appropriate error message should be shown to the  user. <br>
   
    </li>
  </ul>
    
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To implement the &quot;login&quot; and &quot;register&quot; function on your website.<br> <br></li>

<ul>
  <!-- <li>Once logged on, on &quot;my orders&quot; page, a user can view his last three months' order(s)  if any.<br /><br /></li> -->
  <li>When a new user makes an order, a new account/username and a temporary password will be created automatically after order confirmation. User's personal details will be saved in database under the created account/username.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Once logged on, on &quot;my account&quot; page, a user can change password and edit personal details.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Once logged on, user's registered name should be displayed at a proper location on the pages accordingly.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>When a logged on user makes an order, the shipping details in the checkout form 
  can be auto-filled directly with the information collected on  &quot;my account&quot; page. The details should be editable. </li>
  
</ul>

</ul>
